//Assignment#12//

/*Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
The text of each message should be the same,
 but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.*/

//Making an Array//
let names:string[]= ["Nusrat", "Mehreen", "Surraiya","Mehwish", "Nadia"]


 //Printing Friends name usine for each method//
 names.forEach(friends => {
     console.log(friends + " " + "May Allah Bless You Always" )
 });
